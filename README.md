# README for roms-kate-mgh

This is a Git repository of Kate Hedstroms' ROMS source code with changes made by Mark Hadfield
at NIWA. The master copy is held on the NIWA Gitlab server in project hadfield/roms-kate-mgh.

Kate's repository is hosted at

  https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms.git

The intention for the current repository is to regularly fetch and incorporate changes from Kate's
repository. The branch kate_svn in the remote will be merged with the local master branch.

Because the remote repository is in Git, not Subversion, format, I am not keeping a local copy of
the unaltered remote.
